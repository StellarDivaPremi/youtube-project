YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using Streamlit,Python and MySQL done by Me.

**Overview**

This project aims to provide a platform for users to interact with YouTube data, including channel information, video details, comments, and more. The application utilizes the YouTube API to fetch data and stores it in a MySQL database. Users can then query the database for various insights and analysis.

**Features**

1.Watch YouTube Videos: Users can watch videos from selected YouTube channels directly within the application.
2.Fetch Data from YouTube API: Retrieve channel details, playlist information, video data, and comments from the YouTube API.
3.Export API Data to MySQL Tables: Store fetched data in MySQL tables for long-term storage and analysis.
4.Query MySQL Tables: Execute SQL queries to analyze the stored data, such as finding top videos, channel statistics, comment counts, etc.

****User-friendly Interface**: The application provides a streamlined interface using Streamlit for easy navigation and interaction.
